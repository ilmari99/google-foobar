# **My Google Foobar coding challenge**
Problems and solutions I encountered during my Google Foobar challenge.

There were a total of 9 problems:
- Level 1: 1 problem (I don't remember)
- Level 2: 2 problems (simple once fully understood, recursion)
- Level 3: 3 problems (backtracking, recursion, dynamic programming)
- Level 4: 2 problems (maximal flow in graph, ray tracing/mirroring)
- Level 5: 1 problem (Group theory, abstract algebra, symmetries)

I received an invitation for the challenge in the autumn of 2021 after Googling about Bayesian Optimizaton (still no idea what it is). Next thing I know, the space under the search bar unravels a little, revealing the text: *"Programmers like to solve problems, how would you like to solve one for Google?"*

Well certainly!!

Next thing I know I'm in a UNIX-like terminal - and so the journey began.

This used to be a way for Google to recruit programmers, but it is apparently deprecated.

Overall, a worthwhile experience with captivating problems. Problems on levels 4 and especially 5 were the single hardest problems I've solved so far.
