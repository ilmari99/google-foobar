# **My Google Foobar coding challenge**
Problems and solutions I encountered during my Google Foobar challenge.

I received an invitation for the challenge in the autumn of 2021 after Googling about Bayesian Optimizaton (no idea how it works, that's why I Googled it). Next thing I know, the space under the search bar unravels a little, revealing the text: *"Programmers like to solve problems, how would you like to solve one for Google?"*

Well certainly!!

Next I'm in a UNIX-like terminal - and so the journey began.
